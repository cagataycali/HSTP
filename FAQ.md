- What is HSTP?

HSTP is a simple network protocol mapping HTTP requests to TCP connections. It is designed to be simple and easy to implement. The protocol itself creates a ecosystem for the development of decentralized applications.

HSTP is the protocol core for cross chain bridge applications.

Core concepts:
- query
- mutation
- subscription
- registry
- resolver

- What is the difference between query, mutation, and subscription?

Query is used to fetch data from the chain. Mutation is used to modify data on the chain. Subscription is used to subscribe to data changes on the chain.

- What is the difference between query and mutation?

Query is used to fetch data from the chain. Mutation is used to modify data on the chain.

- What is the difference between query and subscription?

Query is used to fetch data from the chain. Subscription is used to subscribe to data changes on the chain.

- What is the difference between mutation and subscription?

Mutation is used to modify data on the chain. Subscription is used to subscribe to data changes on the chain.


- How cross chain bridges works?

Cross-chain bridges are mechanisms that enable the transfer of assets or data between two different blockchain networks. This can be useful in cases where two different blockchain networks have assets or data that need to be used or accessed on the other network. For example, a user on one blockchain network may want to use a decentralized application (DApp) on another blockchain network that requires a specific asset that is only available on the first network.

There are a few different ways that cross-chain bridges can be implemented, but one common approach is to use a multi-signature account or a smart contract as a "middleman" to facilitate the transfer of assets between the two networks. When a user wants to transfer an asset from one network to the other, they will send the asset to the middleman account or contract, which will then release the asset on the other network to the designated recipient. This process typically requires the participation of multiple parties, such as validators or custodians, to ensure the security and integrity of the transfer.

Overall, cross-chain bridges can help to increase interoperability between different blockchain networks and enable the use of assets or data in a wider range of contexts.

The implementation of cross-chain bridges can vary in several ways, and the specific details of how a given bridge works will depend on its design and the technologies it is built on. Some factors that may affect the implementation of a cross-chain bridge include:

The type of asset or data being transferred: Different types of assets or data may require different approaches to transfer across networks. For example, transferring a simple token may be relatively straightforward, while transferring more complex assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may require additional considerations.

The blockchains involved: The specific blockchain networks that are being connected by the bridge will also influence the implementation. Different blockchains have different capabilities and constraints, and a bridge that works well for one pair of networks may not be suitable for another.

The mechanism used to facilitate transfers: As mentioned earlier, one common approach to building a cross-chain bridge is to use a multi-signature account or a smart contract as a "middleman" to facilitate the transfer of assets between the two networks. However, there are other approaches that can be used as well, such as using a central third-party custodian or relying on atomic swaps. The choice of mechanism will depend on the specific requirements of the bridge and the trade-offs that are acceptable.

Overall, the design and implementation of a cross-chain bridge will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project, as well as the technologies and approaches that are available.



- What is the difference between HSTP and HTTP?

HSTP is not a real protocol. It appears to be a made-up acronym that does not correspond to any known protocol or technology.

On the other hand, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely-used network protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as web pages, over the Internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used by web browsers and chains to communicate with each other. HTTP specifies how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web chains and clients should take in response to various commands.

There is no direct relationship between HSTP and HTTP. It is possible that HSTP was intended to be a simplified or modified version of HTTP, but without further context it is difficult to say for sure.
